# AnimeList

## Project Description

A website that you can use to browse a list of anime and manga by different type of parameters such as genre, year, studio, etc. You can also login and create your own personal list of anime/manga. 

This project will be much more front-end heavy because the back-end is just responsible for user login and creating list for the anime/manga.

## ERD Draft

- Note : I will be utilizing a third party api, so the current ERD is just a rudimentary draft of what the backend is responsible for. The user should be able to login and utilize the api to make their own personal watch/reading list.
